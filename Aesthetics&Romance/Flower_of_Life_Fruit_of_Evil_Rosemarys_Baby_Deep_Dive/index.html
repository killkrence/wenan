<h1 id="_1">生命之花、恶魔之实 《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》 深度解读</h1>
<p>欢迎回来。我们今天将会一同来欣赏一部十分特别的恐怖电影，它有着许多不同的译名，像《魔鬼圣婴》、《蚀音记》等等。但我猜最令我们熟悉的名字，应该就是《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》了。在开头还是想要提醒一下各位，就是这期节目在长度上可能会比较夸张，以及我们采用的方法，是大家口中经常说的“拉片”的方法，但其实也有所不同。因为我们的出发点和视角，并不是单纯的一个电影美学的角度吧，还是会和我们频道大多数节目的风味类似啊，会以一个偏社会、人们在一个掺入部分哲学议题的情境下，一起来聊天。再简单来说，就是大家看上一段，我们来聊上一段。以及如果你是一位女性的话，恰巧好像没有看过这部叫做《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》的电影，碰巧又最近打算结婚，但是并没有经历长时间的同居生活，又碰巧你在自己的人生规划中，已经将创造下一代的事项提上了日程的话，那么最好在观看这部影片以及我们这则视频之前，做上一些心理准备。其实这个忠告也同样适用于正在观看这则视频的所有男同胞们。</p>
<p>“Are you a doctor?” 
“Yes.” 
“He's an actor. An actor who are very popular with actors.” 
“Have I, uh, seen you in anything?” 
“Haha. Let's see. I… I did Hamlet a while back. Then I did Lysistrata. And then we did The, uh, the same Piper.” 
“He's joking.” 
“He was in Luther and Nobody Loves an Albatross. And a lot of television plays, some commercials. So that's where the money is.” 
“Isn't it the commercial and the artistic girls too?” 
“Yeah. Seven years ago, originally the smallest apartment was at nine. They've been broken up into four, five, and sixes. A seventy is a four. Rationally the back part of the ten. It has the original dining room for his living room. Another bedroom for the bedroom, and two servants from its song together for a dining room or a second bedroom. You have children?” 
“Uh, we planned to. We must toil.” 
“That's why did you…” 
“This way, please. The previous tenant, Mrs. Gardinia, passed away just a few days ago. So nothing has been moved yet. Her son asked me to say that some of the furniture could be picked up practically for the asking. Did she die in the apartment?” 
“Not here. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. In a hospital. She's been in a coma for weeks after you left. Thank you. She was very old and passed away without ever waking. Grateful to go that way myself when the time comes.” 
“Oh, no, no, no. Not in the apartment. No, she was chipper right to the end. Been one of the first women lawyers in New York City. Did a little gardening on the side. Dude. It's quite a woman. Oh, closet! Oh, plenty of closets.” 
“A nice view of the park. Or very nice view. Now this room, for instance. It would make a lovely nursery. Yes, yellow and white wallpaper would brighten it tremendously. What are all these things here?” 
“Herbs, mostly. A nice large bathroom. Mint, basil, uh, no, marijuana, uh, uh-huh. Master's bedroom. Here we are back at the hallway again. There.” 
“Oh, oh god. Fireplace works, of course, right?” 
“Oh. Oh, it's a wonderful apartment. I love to see what she's trying to do. She's trying to get you lower the rents.” 
“Yes. Well, we'd raise it if we were allowed. Apartment with this kind of charm. Why, that's it. Has a closet behind that secretary. I'm sure there is.” 
“Uh, I think you're right. She moved it. It used to be there. Give me Willy.” 
“I see now why she went into a coma. Ha ha ha ha ha! She couldn't lift it by herself.” 
“She was eighty-nine.” 
“Should we open it? Maybe a sunshade.” 
“I'm authorized to show the apartment. Well.” 
“Where was she locked in? Got out. Or perhaps she didn't need five closets.” 
“But why would she cover up a vacuum cleaner in a towel?” 
“Um, I don't suppose we'll ever know. Maybe she was becoming senile after all. Is there anything else?” 
“Yes, please. What about the laundry facilities? It's bigger than the other one.” 
“Yeah, it's more expensive too. You know.” 
“It's better located. Yeah. Well, God knows I could walk to all the theaters from here.” 
“Oh, Guy, let's take it. Please.” 
“That living room could be…” 
“Oh, please, let's take it.” 
“Okay, darling. We get out of the other lady.” </p>
<p>这是一部1968年的电影，它由罗曼·波兰斯基执导，改编自美国作家艾拉·莱文的同名恐怖惊悚类小说《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》。在那个老电影的时代，经常会有一种在影迷社群里出现的迷信，诸如正派的主角们都是从荧幕的左侧入场的，这在视觉上就会给人带来一种舒适感。而反派则会集中在屏幕的右侧，与正派处于一个对立的状态。这种辨别正反派的方法，在更老一些的电影中确实行之有效。就拿那些知名的、诞生于30到40年代的哥特式吸血鬼电影来说，我们就能发现，在吸血鬼第一次入场的情景中，吸血鬼们总是会无意识地偏向整体构图的右侧，而善良美丽的女主角们，则通常会出现在荧幕的左侧。那只不过时间来到了《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》这个年代，这种曾经被认为是电影手法的辨认方法，已经成为了一种迷信和过去式了。只不过我们依旧可以大胆地猜测，导演是不是在这个漫长的入场戏份中，加入了一丝丝迷信的意味，那种怀旧的手法，就像大导演希区柯克会在他的惊悚悬疑类影片里的做法一样。</p>
<p>这是电影的开场，讲述了两位年轻人来到纽约的布拉德福德大厦看房，一间拥有着四个房间的大公寓。我们能从开场幕的这一连串镜头了解到，布拉德福德大厦是一栋维多利亚式的建筑，老旧且缺乏修缮。我们还能从角色们的对白中知晓，女主人公的先生是一位演员，一位拍过《路德》和《媒人喜爱的信天翁》，以及许多电视剧和广告片的小演员。我们还能发现，女主角有着60年代到70年代的美国女性特质，那其中最为典型的就是她痴迷于当时十分流行的哥特式风格，并且为这处带有强烈古典色彩的四居室公寓感到兴奋。即使这个公寓的前住客，一位老妇人因为在房间里昏迷而去世，也无法浇灭她的热情。即使关于那位老妇人离世的故事，怎么想都叫人感到有点古怪：她居然顶着八九十岁的高龄，想要去挪动一个看上去两位壮汉都难以应付的大衣柜，目的则只是为了去堵住另一个与这个巨大衣柜有着相同功用的内置衣柜。在最后我们都清楚地知道了影片的两位主角，决定要租下布拉德福德大厦的这间四居室公寓。在那个年代，没有一位美国女性能够抵抗得了古典的诱惑，在恐怖片就更是如此了。我们在之前的节目中有聊到过，美国的60到70年代是一个颓废的年代。文化的快速转向、惊人的政治事件、精神分析学的崛起、人类学的落幕、科学与信仰的对立，都给当时的美国社会套上了一层独特的末世氛围。也就是在这样的土壤之下，滋生出了一种别样的古典文化，那就是追逐古典文化的泛流行文化。我们也可以将它不太严谨地称之为一种带有反思意味的复古风潮，反思的正是科学与信仰之间的关系。对于拥有着3000万天主教徒的美国来说，这个确实是一件大事。</p>
<p>“He was tempted to write the management that you were drug addicts and litter bugs. Instead, I decided to lie and tell the… you were wonderful tempers. You're great, honey. I wish I could talk you out of it, though he's pulling your leg.” 
“Grow, honey, I just got a new look. That's great! Are you aware that the Branford had rather an unpleasant reputation around the turn of the century? It's where the Trench Sisters conducted their little dietary experiment. And Keith Kennedy had all these parties. Adrian Marcato lived there too. So did Peg and Trace sisters. The Trench sisters were two proper Victorian ladies. They cooked and ate several young children, including a niece.” 
“Oh, lovely. Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft. He made quite a splash in the nineties by announcing that he had conjured up the living Devil. Apparently, people believed him, so they attacked and nearly killed him in the lobby of the Branford.” 
“You're joking.” 
“Later the Keith Kennedy business began. And by the twenties, the house was half empty. And I knew about Keith Kennedy. I didn't know that Marcato over there. And those sisters who bought... who filled the house up again. Terrific! The house, the lamb.” 
“They called him Black Branford. But what awful things happen in every apartment house.” 
“Well, this house has a high incident of unpleasant happenings. In fifty-nine, a dead infant was found wrapped in newspaper in the basement.” 
“Um, you really rouse my appetite.” 
“Have some more wine.” </p>
<p>这一幕为我们带来了本片的最大主题——“恶魔”。看起来，布拉德福德大厦曾经出现过一些在经济构筑的房产世界里的污点，那就是有人曾经在那儿大搞恶魔崇拜，甚至是练习巫术。更有一对叫特伦的姐妹在那栋大厦里烹煮小孩。那甚至有人在大厦的地下室里发现过一名死婴。最终，所有的这些怪力乱神，都被定格在了讲述这些民俗故事的老先生那希区柯克式的笑容上了。除此之外，这一幕情景中，角色与角色的互动，还向我们抛来了一个非常有趣的话题，就是一个家庭与另一个家庭之间的安全距离。乍听之下可能有点抽象，但是这个话题对于这部电影来说是至关重要的，我们之后便会聊到它。</p>
<p>“Grown man bring me out to move there when you come. Hey, these are shelves. Hey, let's make that. I think I hear the Trench sisters chewing. You're a deca Floridian. The 250cc 100 miles classic with Yamaha leading the pack on the final lap and winning it as Yamaha takes seven of the top ten places. It's the third straight year for Yamaha's clean sweep. Yamaha is race-bred from champions. And as you can see, we have a model for every kind of writing. You know, you really should discover the swinging world of Yamaha. Why don't you get on? Have a ride. Come on, come on. Okay. Come on, let's go. It's great, you know.” </p>
<p>我们之中的大部分人可能都会对这一幕感到疑惑。因为影片几乎在不带有任何色彩性渲染的前提下，就安排女主角与男主角展开了一场灵魂的交流。从女主角提出要求到最后男主角的糟糕玩笑，一切都显得机械而生硬，似乎既寻不见新婚的甜蜜，也没有爱情所带来的快乐。在这一点上，它与任何一部诞生于60到70年代的电影都是完全相悖的。毫不夸张地说，这里的处理方法，以一部改编自畅销小说的电影而言，显得十分另类。那实际上我们几乎可以认定，这是导演的故意为之。本片的主角罗斯玛丽，是一名有着些许孩子气的全职太太。而片中的男主角盖伊·伍德豪斯，则是一名在罗斯玛丽眼中充满了魅力的演员，而且要比他大了整整有九岁。年龄的差距，就已经表明了二人在沟通上可能会存在的问题。同时，罗斯玛丽还有着当时社会背景下传统女性的一大认知，就是生小孩。为了生小孩这件事情，罗斯玛丽不惜以戳破安全套、偷偷不吃避孕药等等手段来对抗盖伊一切以事业为重的态度。这些都被写进了原著小说当中，因此我们便看到了刚刚那略显尴尬与不自然的一幕了。同时本片的时间点恰好处在第二波女性主义运动爆发期间。在这些基础之上，我们便能理解导演的安排与想要表达的大概内容了。以及致使罗斯玛丽急切地想要孩子的另一个原因，除了当时社会文化对于女性的影响之外，就是家庭文化的驯化。罗斯玛丽来自于一个彻底的宗教家庭——天主教。从原著中我们能知道，罗斯玛丽有五个兄妹，她排行老六。她的哥哥姐姐们都已育有后代。就是在这种外在文化与内在驯化的双重影响之下，即使罗斯玛丽能够算得上是一位清醒的、受当时女性文化运动影响的、喜欢打破传统的新兴全职太太，但是也不可避免地会被之前的家庭文化所影响、所裹挟，会被她人拥有而我还未拥有的存在侵蚀，从而对虚无产生出无限可怕的遐想。其中就有可能包括了有关于自我价值的内容，也就是我们经常能够在许多啊、在过去许多女性前辈身上观察到的，似乎生儿育女已经被当做成了完成自我价值的一环了。正如这一幕的后半段罗斯玛丽为我们上演的生活乐趣一样啊，故人粉刷墙壁、购买家具、布置房间，兴趣盎然。而镜头在最后则又指向了电视机中象征着事业的男主角盖伊。罗斯玛丽背对我们，凝望着他。导演也正是使用了这样的手法，再一次地强调了罗斯玛丽这名角色的家庭观念。</p>
<p>“I'm… I'm sorry. I… I thought you were Victoria Ventnor, the actress.” 
“I'm sorry. All right, a lot of people think I'm Victoria. I don't see any resemblance, do you? Huh? No. My name is Terry Ginorio. Nice to meet you. I'm Rosemary Woodhouse. Uh, we… we're new tenants here. I'm staying with the Castevets on the seventh floor. I'm their guest, a sort of… since June. Our apartment used to be the back part of yours.” 
“For goodness sake! She took the old lady's apart from Mrs. Uh, yeah. Um… uh, God. Gardinia. Gardinia.” 
“Yeah. She was a good friend of the Castevets. She used to grow all kinds of herbs and things for her to cook with.” 
“Saw those plants now.” 
“Well, now she grows her own things. We, excuse me, moi, have to put the softener in. What does your husband do? He's an actor. No kidding. What's his name? Guy Woodhouse. He was in Luther and Nobody Loves an Albatross. And he does a lot of television and radio. Guy watched TV all day long. I'll bet I've seen him.” 
“Wow.” 
“Oh. I hate this basement. You want me to? Gives me the creeps. Say, listen. Why don't we come down here together regular and do our laundry? Okay, that'd be great.” 
“I have a good luck charm. It might work for both of us. Oh, that's beautiful. Isn't it? Hmm. Mrs. Castevet gave it to me. It's good luck. Or anyway, it's supposed to be.” 
“It's got some stuff inside. Ha ha ha!” 
“I'm not mad about the smell either. I hope it works.” 
“It's a beautiful charm, though. I've never seen anything like it. European? The Castevets are the most wonderful people in the world. Bar none. You know, they picked me up off the sidewalk, literally. He was sick. I was starving and on dope, and doing a lot of other things. Their childless. Though I'm like the daughter they never had. The first. I thought they wanted me for some kind of a sex thing. But they've turned out to be like real grandparents. It's nice to know there are people like that when you hear so much about apathy and people who are afraid of getting involved. I'd be dead or in jail. Who wasn't for them. That's an absolute fact. Dead or in jail.” 
“You don't have any family that could have helped you?” 
“A brother in the navy. If you want my… shouldn't that my… that must be the partition. The back part of the original ten was a dining one. And there's… there's a closet over here. And then there's a closet over here. Yeah.” 
“撒贝。”</p>
<p>我们在这一幕与女主角罗斯玛丽来到了位于地下室的洗衣间，那正是前几幕里那位胖乎乎的、拥有着英国口音的老先生角色所说到的、出现了弃婴的地下室。在这间地下室，罗斯玛丽认识了一位意大利裔女孩，并向她介绍自己那演过《路德》与《媒人喜爱的信天翁》的丈夫。那位女孩自称与卡斯维夫妇住在一起，进而我们了解到卡斯维夫妇同时也是罗斯玛丽和他先生盖伊的邻居。并且在这一幕中，对白还刻意地强调了他们的公寓原本是相通的这件事情。这一点在第一幕当中，负责向小夫妻俩展示公寓的管理员也有说明。同时我们还看到了卡斯维夫妇送给意大利裔女孩的一条吊坠，一条据说能带来好运，但是却散发着令人厌恶气味的银质圆形吊饰。导演将整个段落处理得相当生活化，那如果你在观影期间不卖力地提醒自己这是一部恐怖惊悚类的电影的话，可能会渐渐地感觉自己正在看的是一部来自于80年代左右的美式情景喜剧。</p>
<p>“Ready, ready. Get back now. Will you please get back? There's nothing to see. Get back. You know her?” 
“What's your name?” 
“Terry.” 
“Terry, what? Roll. What's your name again? Terry Ginorio. Uh, I do remember a Italian thing. You're staying with some people named Castevet? On the seventh floor.” 
“Yeah.” 
“We got that already. Short and sweet and stuck it into the windows, so with a Band-Aid, Terry.” 
“Message. You're not for you.” 
“Hold on. Hold on. You know it only started. Here they come. You folks, the Castevets on the seventh floor.” 
“We are.” 
“You have a young woman named Teresa Ginorio living with you?” 
“We do, but what's wrong? Has there been an accident?” 
“You'd better brace yourself for some bad news. She's dead. Jumped out of the window.” 
“That's not possible. It's a mistake.” 
“Party won't let these folks take a look. Please.” 
“I knew this would happen. She got deeply depressed every three weeks or so. I told my wife about it, but she poo-pooed me.” 
“Well, it doesn't mean she killed herself. She's a very happy girl. No reason for self-destruction. She must have been cleaning the windows or something.” 
“She wasn't cleaning windows at midnight.” 
“Why not? Maybe she was.” 
“Is that her handwriting?” 
“Dear, definitely, absolutely.” 
“Thank you. I'll see this gets back to you when we're done with it. I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. She was so happy. Who's the next kid?” 
“Oh, she's all alone. She didn't have anybody. Only yes. Didn't she have a brother?” 
“Did she? She said she did. In the Navy. News to me. Do you know where he stationed?” 
“No. I don't. She… she mentioned him to me in the laundry room.” 
“I'm Rosemary Woodhouse. Uh, we're in seven eight.” 
“I feel just the way you do, Mrs. Castevet. She seems so happy and full of…” 
“She said wonderful things about you and your husband. How grateful she was.” 
“Do you know anything else about his brother? Except he's in the Navy.” 
“It should be easy to find him.” 
“One says, 'Standing it's so swell.' Thanks.” 
“Sometimes I wonder if I'm coming the leader of anything.” 
“Please don't tell me with the… the leaves. And because I'm not interested.” 
“Listen to me. We wouldn't have to do this. We've been all set to go. Now instead of having to start all over from scratch.” 
“I told you not to. I told you she wouldn't be open-minded. I told Sister Veronica about the windows. And she withdrew the school from the competition. Otherwise…” </p>
<p>到目前为止，电影都在按照原著小说的叙事结构，利用镜头向我们呈现视觉化的故事脉络。这一幕的内容几乎完整地还原了原著小说，从对白到着装到故事氛围无一疏漏。因为地下室中与罗斯玛丽攀谈的意大利裔少女跳楼身亡，我们见到了那位已故女孩口中提到的卡斯维夫妇，以及穿着睡衣、慌慌张张寻声而来的公寓管理员。也知晓了那位女孩的无亲无故。故事从这一幕开始，才算真正地拉开了序幕。我们在之后的一连串描写梦境的镜头中，窥见了罗斯玛丽的心理状态。显然，罗斯玛丽因为突如其来的坠楼事件而心神不宁。噩梦让她无意识地将自己目睹的惨剧，转为了一份有意识的焦虑。而这一切全部都来自于，也指向了她的成长经历——一些曾经发生过的，并被清晰认知到的存在。在原著中我们能了解到，罗斯玛丽的高中学业是在一所天主教中学完成的，而在她的学习生涯中，她却因为诚实而遭到了修女的斥责。在这一幕，原著中提及的回忆并没有被具体地表达出来，相反被以一种十分意识流的方式渲染，并展现出了罗斯玛丽的心理状态，一种经由无意识而产生出的焦虑。它在罗斯玛丽这儿所指向的焦点，便是不公二字。罗斯玛丽觉得她所信奉的上帝对那位意大利裔的少女不公，也觉得自己高中时期的那位嬷嬷、那位修女对她不公。</p>
<p>“Hello, how are you? I never come in a minute. Yes, of course. Pastry. I just came over to thank you for saying those nice things to us the other night. Poor Terry. We thought maybe we failed her some way, though her note made it crystal clear we had. And she'll never know how happy it wasn't such a shock moment. So I do thank you, Roman does too. Rosemary, you're welcome.” 
“I'm glad I could help.” 
“Yeah. Well, she's cremated yesterday. Now we've got to forget and go on. It won't be easy. But all my children of our own you have.” 
“And no, we don't know.” 
“Well, there you go. Oh, that's a nice look at you. Put the table. And was not arrested. I saw it in a magazine.” 
“Oh, my nice painter!” 
“Uh, uh-oh. This place. Where is this? A TV room?” 
“Yeah, well, only temporarily. It's going to be a nursery.” 
“Are you pregnant?” 
“No, not yet. I hope to be as soon as we settle.” 
“Wonderful. Were you young and healthy? Out of lot of children? And we plan to have three.” 
“I didn't see what you did to this apartment. The woman had it before you, dear friend of mine.” 
“I know Terry told me. What did she do to us?” 
“Some long talks together in the laundry room. Only one.” 
“Oh, oh my God. Ha ha! It looks so much brighter. Will you pick a chair right there?” 
“Oh, oh, I'm… I'm not sure, really.” 
“I think about two hundred dollars.” 
“Where's your hobby, darling? He's an actor. I knew it. I said it a Roman yesterday. He's so good looking. What movies was he in? No movies. He was in two plays called Luther and Nobody Loves an Albatross. And a lot of television and radio.” 
“Listen, Rosemary, I got a two-inch thick sirloin steak sitting in deep frost right this minute. When you and Guy come back, you'll feel better. We'll have this tonight.” 
“What do you say? No, that we couldn't? Well, no, not really.” 
“That's very kind of you. It'd be a real help to us. Our first night will be alone. Since… Are you sure it wouldn't be too much trouble? Honey, it's no trouble. I wouldn't ask you. All right. You go ahead and count on us. So, I'll have to check with Guy, though.” 
“Listen, you tell him I won't take no for an answer. Oh, here's a nail. Now, and thank you, okay.” 
“Donald Bumgard got that part. It's a bad play anyway. Now, even if it folds out of town, it's a kind of part that gets noticed.” 
“Mrs. Castevet was here to thank me for what I said about Terry. She is the nosiest person I've ever seen. You know, she actually asked the prices of things. Okay. She invited us to have dinner with them tonight. I told you I'd have to check with you. But that it would probably be okay.” 
“Oh, Jesus, we don't have to do that, do we, honey?” 
“I think they're lonely. If we get friendly with an old couple like that, it'll never get rid of them. They're right across the hall.” 
“I told her she could count on us. You don't have to sulk about it.” 
“I'm not sulking. I see exactly what you mean. That will go. No, no, no, what for? We'll go. No, we don't have to if you don't want to. That sounds so funny, but I really mean it. Really I do. Be my good deal for today. Okay. But only if you want to. And we'll make it clear that it's just for this one night, and not the beginning of anything. Right.” </p>
<p>擅长交际的人是什么样的？卡斯维夫人在这一幕当中，就为我们带来了一个绝佳的范本。直爽利落的言语会让人觉得你很真诚，紧接着的赞美声就会从奉承变成一种令人心花怒放的魔咒了。卡斯维夫人毫不避讳地与罗斯玛丽谈论寄住在自家的刚刚去世的意大利裔女孩，也大大方方地参观罗斯玛丽的公寓，仿佛这一切都是她应该要做的。期间自然也夹杂着对罗斯玛丽的热情赞美。这是罗斯玛丽第一次与卡斯维夫人见面，也是卡斯维夫妇第一次与罗斯玛丽及盖伊这一小小的家庭产生交集。似乎这在邻里之间非常的寻常，但是各位不要忘了，我们在上面提到的家庭与家庭之间的安全距离这么一件事情。电影的诸多细节都在表达这一内容。就像原著小说里所描绘的那样，在这一幕中，卡斯维夫人邀请小两口晚上前去做客，她将会以一块牛排来款待他们。我想，此时无论罗斯玛丽如何去回答卡斯维夫妇，我们作为观众，我们也一定会知道一部恐怖电影的剧情将会走向何处，对吧？</p>
<p>于是我们便看到了罗斯玛丽对着盖伊闹情绪的段落，因为夫妻俩无法在人际应酬这么一件事情上达成一致。值得我们注意的是，导演刻意地隐藏了罗斯玛丽想要去做客的动机，放大了她与丈夫之间的沟通问题。事实上，罗斯玛丽在这里表现出了她善良的本性，并非只是孩子气般的瞎闹腾。从原著我们能了解到，罗斯玛丽的动机，只是因为她觉得卡斯维夫妇会因为少女的死而难过，她想要陪他们热闹热闹，以防止另外一出惨剧的发生。而在这里，导演则是放大了罗斯玛丽与她丈夫盖伊在沟通上的问题，并且刻意地回避掉了罗斯玛丽的动机，回避掉了这位太太的善良。而我们都知道，想要将罗斯玛丽的善良表达明朗，需要的可能只是一句台词的功夫而已。导演之所以这么处理的原因其实非常简单，因为这一幕导演是从盖伊的视角来进行拍摄的。可以说，导演潜移默化地让我们体验了年长了整整九岁的盖伊与罗斯玛丽的沟通状态。那很有可能不是罗斯玛丽没说，而是盖伊压根就没有在听，就像是哄小女孩似的，只要对方开心就好了的一种心理状态。仔细的观众们也会发现，这里的镜头也如我们在一开始聊到的那样，从盖伊进门与罗斯玛丽拥抱，到坐下吃三明治，荧幕方向都是从左至右进行的。盖伊此时在荧幕的左侧，而罗斯玛丽在荧幕的右侧。就像我们之前所说的，正派与反派的荧幕结构一样。这种细微的构图，影响了我们对这一幕中人物形象的直接感受，就像是一种迷信一样。因此我们会觉得这一幕中的罗斯玛丽十分孩子气，感觉她在这一幕中的形象，就像是一个正在玩着玩具的小女孩。虽然她在做的是窗帘店。</p>
<p>“Oh, perfect timing. Come on in, Roman, Victor, son. Black C. Blushes. My, I'm glad you could come, Guy. But tell everybody that I know you well. The dinner isn't ready just yet. But today, there anyway. Left. Take a seat down on the couch. You're going to find yourself. But I seem to have overfilled the glasses. No, no, no. Don't get out. Generally, I pull these out precisely. Bartender, don't even. Just watch the carpet. But this evening, I made a little too much. And rather, I'm for there we are. No, no, no. Sit down, please.” 
“Now, Mrs. Woodhouse, uh, Mr. Woodhouse, uh, vodka blush, uh, have you ever, ever tasted one? No.” 
“It looks delicious, Minnie.” 
“They're very popular in Australia. Now to our guests, welcome to our home. Cheers. Oh, uh, uh, carpet. Oh, dear. Brand new carpet, this man. So, Columbus. Do you come from Australia?” 
“Oh, no, no. I'm from right here in New York City. I've been there, though. I've been everywhere, literally. You name a place, I've been there. Go ahead, name a place. Fairbanks, Alaska.” 
“I've been there. Been all over Alaska. Yes, Fairbanks, Juno, Anchorage, Nome, Sitka. Soon I spent four months there.” 
“Really? Are you folks friends?” 
“Well, okay. I'm from Omaha. Guy's from Baltimore. Omaha's a good city. Baltimore is too. Do you travel for business?” 
“Well, business and pleasure both. I'm seventy-nine, and I've been going one place to another since I was ten. You name a place, I've been there. Up stakes, ready. Don't waste your drinks. Now we must take a pill.” 
“No pope ever visits a city where the newspapers are on strike. I heard he's going to postpone it till it's over.” 
“A lot of showbiz. That's exactly what it is. All the costumes are rituals. All religions.” 
“Oh, oh, I think we're a friend, and Rosemary. No, no.” 
“Oh, you're not religious, my dear, are you?” 
“But I was brought up a Catholic.” 
“Now I don't know. Yeah. You looked uncomfortable.” 
“Well, he is the Pope.” 
“Well, now you don't need to have respect for him, because he pretends that he's holy. That's a good point.” 
“When I think what they spend on robes and jewels. A good picture of the hypocrisy behind organized religion was given, I thought, in Luther. Did you ever get to play that leading part, Guy?” 
“Me? No.” 
“Oh, weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?” 
“No.” 
“That's strange. I remember being struck by a gesture you made, and checking in the program to see who you were. Um, what gesture was that?” 
“Well, I'm not sure now. It was a reaction. Oh, I… I did a thing with my arms. And Mother was having a fit with a kind of involuntary region.” 
“That's it. That's it! It had a wonderful authenticity to it. Oh, come on. No, no, I mean it. My father was a theatrical producer in my early years. Was spending the company of Mrs. Fish, Forbes Robertson, Mojica, Guy. Oh, yes, please. You have a most interesting inequality, Guy. It appears in your television work too. It should take you a long way indeed. Provided, of course, that you get those initial breaks. Are you preparing for a show now?” 
“Um, well, I'm up for a couple of parts.” 
“Well, I can't believe that you won't get them. Well, I turn.” 
“I'd like to have a spice garden someday. I guess.” 
“I'm a country girl at heart. You come from a big family, uh-huh? Three brothers and two sisters. Two sisters married, uh-huh. They have children. One has two, the other has four. Oh, what a chance. You have lots of children too.” 
“I'll work fertile. All right. I've got sixteen nieces and nephews. Oh, my goodness. Would you like me to wash and you can wipe for a while? Oh, no, that's fine. You.” 
“Now, Roman, will you stop filling Guy's ears with your majestic stories? He's only listening because he's polite.” 
“No, no, no, no. It's very interesting, Mrs. Castevet. I'm Minnie.” 
“He's Roman.” 
“Okay. Oh, River, just goodbye. D. B. And good block. Yeah. Was lovely. You blushing me?” 
“Yeah, man, that's good kitchen. Oh.” 
“About that steak.” 
“Oh my god. And the cake. How did you eat two pieces?” 
“It was politeness. That's how I eat two pieces. That a polite.” 
“Only three dinner plates that mess. And all that beautiful, beautiful silver would be nice. Maybe they'll leave it to us.” 
“Oh, yeah. Guess what they have in their bathroom. I'll be dead jokes for the job.” 
“No, a book and a hook right next to the toilet. Mama's stories are pretty damn interesting, though. I've never even heard of Forbes Robertson before.” 
“I'm gonna go over there again tomorrow night. And here's some more. You are.” 
“Yeah. Yeah. Me here. Do this damn thing for me. I thought we're gonna do something with Jean and Dick Jellner.” 
“Was that definite?” 
“It was definite. Let's see them next week. You don't have to come alone if you don't want to. You know, you can't stay here. Yeah. I think I will stay here. You know, Henry Irving too. I'm really interesting. Where did they take their pictures down?” 
“What do you mean, the pictures?” 
“They took them down. The hooks in the wall and clean spaces. And the one picture that is there, it doesn't fit.” 
“I didn't notice that.” </p>
<p>这是全片非常重要的一幕。凝视着罗斯玛丽和盖伊一家，正式与卡斯维夫妇一家产生了交集，推进并明晰了故事的发展脉络啊。整幕分为三段：第一段描写了卡斯维夫妇的性格，戏剧化地表达了卡斯维先生的经历。其中第二段是最为重要的一段，那餐桌上的对白几乎为整部影片的后半段添加了合理性的注释，让一切看起来像是在巧合与注定之间摇摆的必然。整个第二段表达了三个重要的内容：第一，男主角盖伊是一位十分享受他人奉承的男性，远远超过了那个年代略显浮夸的寒暄程度。第二，罗斯玛丽作为一个天主教徒，已经渐渐地接受了他人对于自身信仰的嘲笑，自己的先生居然在饭桌上直称教宗的行为是活脱脱的演艺事业。第三，盖伊与罗曼·卡斯维先生聊得非常投机。第三段则是罗斯玛丽与卡斯维夫人在厨房收拾餐具的桥段，期间的话题依旧围绕着罗斯玛丽最为关心的生孩子。而在第三段当中，还有着这一幕里最为精妙的一个镜头，就是罗斯玛丽缓缓回头，看向安静客厅的一瞬间，伴随着流水声以及飘渺的烟雾，一种神秘又危险的基调瞬间划过。导演并没有让这种神秘和危险停留太久，就像之前的拍摄手法一样，现实和噩梦的界限既是模糊的，也是明朗的。很快，这一段在全片中数一数二的重要一幕，就结束在了卡斯维夫人聒噪的话语声当中了。同时在这一幕中，影片也表现出了罗斯玛丽的敏感特质。她细心地发现了卡斯维夫妇的古怪之处，善于布置家装的她很快就发现了卡斯维夫妇似乎在隐藏某些东西。出于对于丈夫的信任，她说了出来，可惜对方不以为然，因为她丈夫的重心已经停留在罗曼·卡斯维先生的故事上了。男主角盖伊对于卡斯维先生的故事感兴趣到了什么程度呢？感兴趣到他准备专门拜访罗曼·卡斯维先生，想要将故事听完。借口则是因为那位先生认识许多的戏剧名人。而至于罗曼到底对盖伊说了什么，他口中的故事到底是什么，我们就不得而知了。就像那句话一样：“有什么比遇到一位不认识的魔鬼更好的事情？那就是遇见一位已经认识的魔鬼。”似乎魔鬼的低语，总是有着几分循循善诱的能力。</p>
<p>“Hi, dear. Wouldn't bother me. Yeah, that's my dear friend, Laurel. Always the good. And he lives upon twelve, Laurel, Louise. This is Guy's wife, Rosemary. Hello, Rosemary, and welcome to the Branford, Louise. Just make Guy. She wants to meet you too. Could we come in? Oh. Of course. Yes. They are going in. Nobody got that. There's a light. I.” 
“Ah, isn't that beautiful? It came this morning. I… All right there. You look worn.” 
“Oh, no, I'm fine. It's the first day of my period. And you're up and around.” 
“On my birthday, I experienced such pain. I couldn't move, eat, or anything. Don used to give me gin for a straw to kill the pain. Girls take things much more in their stride. They're much healthier than we are, thanks to vitamins, better medical care. Well, those things over there, seat covers.” 
“Um, cushions for the window seats. 好耶。” 
“Oh, oh, wait. And before I said again, this is for you from Roman to me for me. Just a little present is all for moving in. There's no risk. Real old. It's over three hundred years. It's lovely. Hey, the green inside is called 'tannis root'. Right? That's for good luck. It's lovely. But I… I can't accept you already have put on. Yeah. Aha, you'll get used to the smell. Don't pour your door. Go on.” 
“You know, whereas stories as interesting as last night. Yes. Did you have a good time? All right. I got a present. It was terrific. No kidding, kind of pretty, though. Aren't you gonna wear it? It smells. The stuff in it. Called tannis root from my greenhouse. Not too bad, though. Can it even? Oh, if you took it, you ought to wear it. Huh.” </p>
<p>在这一幕中，罗斯玛丽的心情很差，整理情绪的她选择播放音乐，拿出书，以让自己放松下来。而她的丈夫就像先前说话的那样，到卡斯维夫妇家去听那神秘的故事去了。罗斯玛丽之所以心情不好，是因为一个只要是女人们都会经历过的生理现象——月经。原本应该安静地、独自度过的，通常也是最为遭罪的月经的第一天，我们的罗斯玛丽却被打扰了。还记得我们先前提到过的邻里之间的安全距离吗？在这一幕里，这种家庭与家庭之间的细小矛盾被表达得无比明晰。更不用说卡斯维夫人和忽然到访的劳拉夫人，对于月经这回事情，有着过来人那样，似乎是充满了先天性的满不在乎。我想对于会痛经的女性来说，在看这一幕时的感触应该是非常深刻的。它可以被轻易地指向现实生活之中。本幕中最为重要的就要当属卡斯维夫人将原本属于意大利裔女孩的银制吊坠转送给了罗斯玛丽的桥段了。故事的脉络、导演所使用的镜头，以及影片里难得会出现的特写，都难免让作为观众的我们猜测罗斯玛丽会不会成为意大利裔女孩的替代品。不然为何要将一个人的遗物转赠他人，特别是在没有良好理由的前提下时，这种行为就更加地匪夷所思了。这不仅仅让东方文化下的我们无法理解，放到西方文化下，也同样是一件令人觉得诡异的事情。更为诡谲的是，当罗斯玛丽向盖伊展示吊坠，并表明银质小球里的叫做“坦尼斯根”的东西很难闻，并不想佩戴时，盖伊居然反驳了她，并说出了“既然收下就应该带上”这番可以说是由威胁的话。大概就是从这一幕开始，可能所有拥有敏感特质的观众，以及大多数的女性观众，都会不自觉地开始怀疑作为丈夫的盖伊，开始觉得她的行为不仅粗鲁，而且古怪。</p>
<p>“Hello? Yes, this is the… Oh, God, no. Oh, poor Guy. And I don't have any idea what's causing it. Oh my God, that's awful! That's just awful. Yes, I would… I mean, yes, I am. I hate to get it that way. But… when you… you have to speak to my agent about that end of it. Alan Stone. I'm sure there won't be any problem. Mr. West, not as far as we're concerned. Thank you, Mr. White. Guy. What is it? Donald Baumgart. He's gone blind. He woke up yesterday, and he can't see.” 
“Oh, no. Oh, I got the part. It's a horrible way to get it. Listen, uh, I have to get out and walk around. Yeah, I understand. Go ahead.” 
“But he can help you.” 
“It's a fascinating part. He'll really be noticed this time. He also has an offer for lead in a television series, Miami Beach. He… he's suddenly very hot. Um, now I understand why you're so overjoyed.” 
“Well, it's a difficult period in his life. A challenge.” 
“I see. You know how actors are all a bit self-centered. I bet even Laurence Olivier is vain and self-centered. It's a difficult part. He's got to work with crutches, and naturally he's preoccupied. And he… Well, preoccupied. I say you had another suicide up there at Happy House. Oh, did I tell you?” 
“No, you didn't.” 
“It was that girl. I told you about the drug addict. Who was rehabilitated by this old couple of Castevets. I'm sure I told you that they didn't rehabilitate her very successfully. It seems. I've been a creep.” 
“It's from wearing Baumgart would regain his sight. Rat that I am.” 
“It's natural. You're bound to feel two ways about it.” 
“Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha for the rest of my days, I'm gonna stop giving you the short end of the stick. You have. As I have. I've been tearing my hair out about my career. Let's have a baby. All right. Let's have three babies, one at a time. All right. A baby. You know, my… my dad, dad, pop, pop. You know what I mean? Sure I mean it. Sure I mean it. I even figured out the right time to start.” 
“Look, you really mean it? Really? No, I'm kidding. Sure I mean it. Oh, roll, honey, for God's sake, don't cry. All right, I want…” </p>
<p>这是全片当中男主人公盖伊白天在家的唯一一幕。整个段落的调度到镜头，都像是在向我们暗示着有一件危险的事情发生的。只是目前这种危险依旧停留在了“意外”、“我很抱歉”等等看似温和的字眼当中。事实上这部《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》演到目前为止都给人一种欲言又止、模棱两可，甚至是摸不着头脑的感觉。然而之所以我们还能够踉踉跄跄地看下来，是因为另一种使我们熟悉的能量挽留了我们。换句话来说就是盖伊和罗斯玛丽，如果能够跳脱出荧幕，离开编剧和导演的控制的话，我们便会发现，这根本就是一出家庭纪实短片。这一幕用危险的镜头向我们展示了盖伊因为竞争对手的突然失明，而拿到了自己想要的角色。同时我们还在这一幕中，看到了盖伊这名角色的巨大反差。想要去散步，这一看上去善良的行为，与充满了危险的镜头调度，形成了一种隐隐约约的对比。到这一幕为止，剧情的推进速度依旧缓慢，就像老式黑白荧幕上的情景剧一样。说句实话，比那个还要慢。</p>
<p>在这一幕的最后，罗斯玛丽找到了之前出场不到3分钟、操着一口浓重英国口音的老先生，诉说了她与盖伊家庭生活里的矛盾。这位老先生叫哈奇，在原著当中，或者应该说在罗斯玛丽的个人故事当中，这位老先生充当着良师益友的角色。早在罗斯玛丽还不认识盖伊的时候，刚刚走进社会的时候，就已经与哈奇结识了。这位老先生是一名作家，有着同时写两本书的爱好，同时也是罗斯玛丽的知识宝库。爱管闲事的性格，也促成了他与罗斯玛丽如同父女一般的关系。就像原著告诉我们的那样，罗斯玛丽那信奉教会且思想极其传统的父母，将她赶出了家门，只因为她想要出门去闯荡。当时西方社会的家庭状态，大多数的全职太太很难与自己的先生沟通，经常会因为一些小矛盾或者小细节而不知所措。例如罗斯玛丽这样的担忧，就几乎会发生在每一位全职太太身上。但是对于她而言，这件当时几乎每位女性都可能会出现的烦恼，会被放得更大。因为她的先生是一位演员，并且是一位即将炙手可热的演员。情感直觉让她感受到了冷落，特别是在面对丈夫是一位演员时，像是“谁能弄清楚一位演员的真情假意”之类的思考，就会更加令人发愁了。这一担忧也很快在这一幕里被勾勒了出来。大树的玫瑰，突然转变了态度的盖伊，都让一切变得无所适从。当然，罗斯玛丽不这么觉得，她很享受。只是作为观众的我们，却对这个之前还显得粗鲁的盖伊变得更加提防起来。盖伊的甜言蜜语，此时在我们看起来更像是大段的谎言，而充满了真诚的眼神，也会令我们觉得无比危险。她对怀孕育子态度的转变，让本应该为此高兴或放松的我们，不禁为罗斯玛丽紧张起来。在我们看来，或者应该说，在这个频道里的大多数观众眼里，罗斯玛丽的激动，那种无以言表的感激之情，我们无法理解。但是放在男权、家庭或是天主教的世界里，这般无法让人理解的行为，便会遭到推崇与赞美。确实，罗斯玛丽是一个好女孩，再到目前为止的故事中，我们都能得到这个结果。只是一个女孩的善良，并不意味着这个女孩所秉持的、被教化与改造过的思想就是善良的，更不意味着世界会充满善意地对待它。这便是小说原著励志与表达的内容，也是为何这部影片会做出如此之长的、围绕着家庭生活进行铺垫的原因之一。生儿育女确实是两个人共同的决定，但是罗斯玛丽的执着，已经超出了决定的范畴，从商量变成了一种恳求。在表达上，小说原著和电影都不约而同地进行了一种任务式的叙述，就像罗斯玛丽是在完成一件任务一样，即使她真的非常喜爱小孩。这便同时引来了两方面的思考：在女性主义运动文化下，罗斯玛丽的行为让人不可理解。但是从罗斯玛丽的角度出发，我们又无法挑剔她做出的选择。个人的自由与文化浪潮之间的对决，不这么说并不贴切。应该是被教养多年的传统女性，在新文化浪潮冲击下的情景，在很大程度上，这种情景足够荒唐，且充满了黑色幽默的意味。</p>
<p>“Here goes nothing. Em, em, em. The pain, the pain. Good grief. Nobody but nobody has a fire tonight. Isn't it gorgeous? I hope we have the coldest winter ever. Hi, guys! How are you? No, don't let her in out tonight without me.” 
“Who says there's nothing to especially Madonna? Miss, you shall have your dessert after all the musso chala do. As many calls it chocolate mousse. I was afraid she'd stay all evening.” 
“Oh, she just wanted us to try it. Spinach is one of her specialties. It was sweet.” 
“But really, we shouldn't make fun of it. Yeah, you're right. All right.” 
“Hmm, that's good. It has an undertaste. A chalky undertaste.” 
“I don't get that. That's silly, honey. There is no undertaste. There is.” 
“Come on, the old bat slaved all day. You're not going to eat it?” 
“I like it. It's delicious.” 
“Yeah, you can have as much. I don't need it. There's always something wrong. Oh, if it's gonna turn into a big thing. If you really can't stand it, just don't eat it. Um, it's delicious. No end to taste it all. Wouldn't you turn the record over? Please.” 
“There, Daddy. Do I get a gold star? And get two of them. I'm sorry, I was stuffy.” 
“You were. It was making a full circle of the ball. It's the Pope and Yankee Stadium walking to especially built canopy. And second price with a mom. Listen to that crowd. Everywhere the Pope has been today has received this type of perception. Once not put in this afternoon.” 
“Perhaps we are being undignified. But this is a special day. And a special day has been. That's a great spot for my Yamaha commercial. Church. We'd like to give you a brief summary of today's dark captions. Pope Paul the Sixth arrived at 9:27 a.m.” 
“What is it?” 
“Daisy. Wonder and all that booze. I didn't need anything all day before they…” </p>
<p>故事即将迎来第一个高潮，也是这个高潮完成了故事从充满社会意味的家庭情景剧走向悬疑惊悚片的转折。我们见证了罗斯玛丽与盖伊口中的“宝宝日”啊，见证了盖伊兑现诺言，要与罗斯玛丽生孩子的实际行动。两人笨拙地点上壁炉，决定以一场烛光晚餐作为他们大事的开场。只是你我都看得出来，这烛光晚宴并不浪漫。我们隔着屏幕都能感受到坐在餐桌前男主人盖伊的愤怒与不情愿。只不过以故事的角度来说，以一个完整知道故事脉络的人，也就是我个人的角度来说，我知道他此时的感受其实是相当复杂的。隔壁卡斯维夫人来敲门，盖伊愤怒地去应门。罗斯玛丽祈求着那位烦人的老太太不要进门，以免坏了她和丈夫之间的大事。她如愿以偿，并且换来的是情绪又突然大好的丈夫，拿着卡斯维夫人送来的甜点，就像我那个年代初中时期为了讨好心仪女生而扭捏作作的大男孩一样。罗斯玛丽的味觉告诉我们，那个由卡斯维夫人做的甜点并不美味，有一股怪味儿。但是盖伊的味觉又告诉我们，似乎一切都非常正常。奇怪的地方就在于，盖伊强烈地要求，并且看似以一种情感挟持的方式，诱导罗斯玛丽将可能真的充满了怪味的甜点全部吃掉。俩人的表现更像是孩子，但是演绎的故事却是成人级别的。因为作为观众的我们已经开始思索那甜点里到底掺了什么东西了。我们会庆幸罗斯玛丽并没有将甜点全部吃完，她偷偷地丢掉了一部分。只可惜即使吃了一小部分，也都一一对应上了我们已经猜到了的故事内容。她开始头晕，就像甜点被人下了药一样。就像我们已经猜到的那样。</p>
<p>“Nice sleep is what you need. Good night's sleep. We have to make a baby.” 
“Oh, well. Well, we'll do it tomorrow. There's plenty of time. Just a nap. Why are you taking the mouth to make you more comfortable? I am more comfortable. Sleep, Rose.” 
“Isn't Hutch coming with us? Catholics only.” 
“I wish we were bound by these prejudices. But unfortunately.” 
“Easy it easy. You gotta too high. Typhon, Typhon. It killed fifty-five people in life. You better go down below this.” 
“This is no dream. This is really happening. I tell you, you have been bitten by a mouse.” 
“Yes, that's why I couldn't come to see you.” 
“Oh, that's all right. We wouldn't want you to jeopardize your health. Am I forgiven, Father? Oh, absolutely.” </p>
<p>罗斯玛丽在这一幕里，经历了她人生故事当中最糟糕的一夜。而我们则以他的视角见证了整个过程。同时也见识到了导演是如何将原著充满意识流的文字，转换成镜头，再以视觉的方式展现出来的。海洋游弋，肯尼迪、丘吉尔，还有罗斯玛丽的良师益友哈奇老先生。她能感觉到丈夫盖伊脱下她的衣服，我们看到了。她能感觉到丈夫盖伊褪下了她手上的婚戒，我们看到了。她仿若浮空漂流，眼前是西斯廷教堂的壁画，米开朗基罗的作品——《上帝对亚当伸出手指赐予生命之光》，就像她一直渴求丈夫对自己做的一样。我们也看到了。她被黑人大副威胁着走下船舱，躺倒在一张大床上，而她身边则围拥着一批进行着弥撒仪式的人，领头的正是她的好邻居卡斯维先生。这我们也看到了。我们还看到了肯尼迪太太穿着白色的绸袍，走下阶梯，与罗斯玛丽轻声细语。我们还看到了教皇，更看到了一只野兽一般的生物，对罗斯玛丽做了她丈夫盖伊本该做的事情。我们都看到了。如果你是第一次看这部影片，在这个片段，你会感受到强烈的不适，以及一份毫无头绪。但是如果各位平日里对西方政治感兴趣，并且多少有了解，那么应该能够洞悉一些镜头画面所想要表达的内容了。只不过今天我们不会在这个视频里谈论政治，以后也不会。在我个人看来，这一段落里的政治内容，只是原著作者的黑色幽默，一种调侃而已。导演也十分戏剧化地将它呈现了出来。而真正重要的内容恰恰与政治无关，毕竟那些都是表象的东西。</p>
<p>要理解如此艺术化的段落，我们就必须重新梳理一下影片为我们埋下的伏笔，那些隐藏在细节之中却又让我们耿耿于怀的内容。在这部影片当中，有一句话被反复地提出，并且似乎是刻意不断地让这个故事里最为重要的角色，也就是罗斯玛丽本人，不断地去重复它。我来帮各位回忆一下，就是经常被罗斯玛丽挂在嘴边的“路德与媒人喜爱的信天翁”故事。到目前为止，这句话已经被提及了四次，而且均分布于这个故事里最为重要的四个情境之中，直到它被以意识流的形式展现在我们刚刚看到的那一幕为止。在剧作故事里，“路德与媒人喜爱的信天翁”是罗斯玛丽的先生盖伊所演的两部戏剧，被他作为谈资挂在了嘴边。单从字面来分析，这句话就隐含深意：“路德”的英文发音非常接近于“loser”（失败者），而在西方文化当中，信天翁经常被誉作善良与忠贞爱情的代表。所以这句话如果从这个角度去理解，就变成了“失败者与没人会喜爱信奉的忠贞爱情”。更可以被我们理解为“失败者与媒人喜爱罗斯玛丽”。当然这只是字面意义上的。那如果你熟悉信天翁，必然就会想起另一个人，他也经常用到信天翁，他就是夏尔·波德莱尔。著名诗人，颓废主义运动的发起人。在他的诗集《恶之花》里，就有一篇标题为《信天翁》的诗词。诗词在开头的前两句就写到：“船上水手时常为了消遣好玩，捕捉信天翁这种巨大的海鸟。真是一些懒洋洋的航海旅伴，在划过苦渊的航船后面缠绕。”这一段诗词中，“苦渊”二字是对大海一种婉转的说法。我们现在可以将罗斯玛丽比喻作信天翁，这解释了这一幕她为何会突然出现在大海上。</p>
<p>之后我们再来看看波德莱尔的另一首诗词，名叫《灯塔》。这首诗词几乎可以说是原著小说这一段落的大纲，更可以说是电影里这一幕的脚本。各位可以听听看：</p>
<p>“达·芬奇深邃而又幽暗的镜子，那里带着极神秘的甜蜜笑容，迷人的天使们，显现在那封闭天国的松鼠和冰川的阴影中。”  各位还记得罗斯玛丽失去意识前她丈夫那神秘的微笑吗？以及灯光下犹如树影一般的阴影。</p>
<p>“伦勃朗充满细雨的愁惨医院，那里只装饰一个巨大十字架，带着哭声的祈祷，从污物、粪便和突然射入的寒光之中散发。”  这一段完美的对应上了船只上的政治色彩。</p>
<p>“米开朗基罗这块空地，只看见赫拉克勒斯混入基督受难图，笔直站立的强大幽灵，在傍晚伸开手，撕掉他们的裹尸布。”  赫拉克勒斯混入基督受难图，就像罗斯玛丽希望犹如亚当一般的创造生命之光。诗词提到了米开朗基罗，并且描绘的内容对应上了罗斯玛丽的遭遇，所映射的上帝与亚当。当然还有那幅西斯廷大教堂由米开朗基罗绘制的著名壁画《创世纪》（或译《天堂》），因为那种“我确实可以作为人类尊严最好的证明，就是随着岁月不断流传，直至在永恒之暗消失的热烈身影”。还记得教宗的出现吗？我想这一段各位光听，应该就知道在描写什么了是吧？全篇诗词挺长的，为了节省时间，我就做些省略了。更关键的是，我不太会唱歌。</p>
<p>波德莱尔这首诗词几乎完美地对应上了这一段落，就像是原著的大纲，又像是影片的脚本。除此之外还有一个更加有意思的细节，那就是《灯塔》这首诗词在《恶之花》出版诗集中的目录编号，它是第六首。而原著当中以及影片当中，在这一幕之前，“六”这个数字只被提出了两次，并且都是由罗斯玛丽本人说出口的，十分刻意。如果加上这个的话，那就是三个“六”。而至于三个“六”代表着什么，我想各位一定比我还清楚。</p>
<p>“Hello there! Do you like it? Oh, yeah. I think I put too much cream, my cocoa.” 
“It… No, no, it was delicious. You have to give me the recipe here. I love you.” 
“Oh, listen. You're going shopping. Do me a tiny favor, will you? It could be six eggs and small instance, sex.” 
“I'm gonna pay you later. Hi, yeah, baby. Don't you think we ought to talk about it? About what? The way you haven't been looking at me.” 
“I'm talking about. I've been looking at you. You haven't. I'm sure I have. Now, what is it? What's the matter?” 
“Nothing. Never mind. No, no. I'll say that. What is it?” 
“Nothing. Look, honey, I know, I know. I've been preoccupied with a part. But it is important. That doesn't mean I don't love you.” 
“Was doing on Friday. It was, uh-huh. You'll probably come tonight or tomorrow. Wanna bet a quarter? Okay. You're gonna lose. Good suck up.” 
“Will you? You're getting me all jumping. It's only been two days. When will I know? I'll call you as soon as I get the results. I'd like to do a general examination. Just know something more. It was the least. Understand? And who recommended you to me, doctor?” 
“Oh, yes. How is she? She's fine, and the boys are great.” 
“Did you deliver all of them?” 
“Not just the last universal hemoglobin. We went to see the Fantastics. How did you enjoy it? Yeah, good.” 
“Hello, Miss Woodhouse. Dr. Hill. Congratulations. Really? Really? There. Oh, yes. Um, what, what happens now? Very little. You come and see me next month. You get those Natalie pills, one a day. Now, mail your forms for the hospital. And when will it be?” 
“George had to be June twenty-eighth. It sounds so far away. It is. Yeah, I'm one more thing. This Woodhouse said. We'd like another blood sample. Oh, yes, of course. What for? Oh, nurse didn't take enough. So would you drop by into you?” 
“But I… I am pregnant. Aren't I?” 
“Oh, yes, it's just for blood, sub-blood, sugar, and so forth. Nothing to be concerned. But you're pregnant?” 
“Don't worry. All right. Well, I'll… I'll come in on Monday. No, I won't. Goodbye to you. Let you go. What's that? Oh, that's great. That's just great. Father, um, mother, go. Ha ha.” 
“Guy, listen. Let's um, make this a new beginning. Okay? A new openness and talking to each other. Because we haven't been open. It's true.” 
“I've been so goddamn self-centered. That's what the whole trouble is. And you know I love you, not your role. I do. I swear. A guy. I'm gonna be as open. It's my. No, bull. It's mine. Now you bear with me, and I'm gonna try and do better. You hear?” 
“Oh, God. What a fine way for parents to be going on. You know what I'd love to do? What? Tell Minnie, Roman. Oh, I know, I know. It's, uh… it's supposed to be a deep, dark secret. But I already told them that we were trying. It was so pleased. Tell them. Be back in two minutes. Huh? You're pregnant? Another blood test. Ah, now that's what I call good news, honey.” 
“Congratulations! Our best wishes, Rosemary. We… we have more peace. And we can say we didn't have any champagne on hand. But this will do just as nice. So what did he do it again? Yeah, okay. Oh, it's gotta be so excited. Listen to you. You got a good doctor.” 
“Oh, yes. Nice one. One of the top obstetricians, is it? Dear friend of ours. Abe Sapirstein delivers all of society's babies. Abe Sapirstein, one of the finest obstetricians in the country. Wasn't he on Oprah a couple of years ago? That's right.” 
“Roll. What? What about Dr. Hill?” 
“Oh, don't worry about Hill. I'll tell him something. You know me. Listen, I don't let you go to no Dr. Hill. Nobody ever heard of. The best is what you're gonna have, young lady. Wizard telephone, huh? It's, uh, in the bedroom. He's a brilliant man. Very sensitive.” 
“Roll, sit down. Sit down.” 
“I'm fine. Ain't Minnie fine? Listen to the dear professor. I just found out today she's pregnant. Uh, yeah, isn't it? I'm gonna report it right now. And we told you you'd be glad to take care of you. Wouldn't charge any of those fancy society prices, neither. Oh, no. Well, just wait a minute, Rosemary. Tomorrow, Monday, at eleven. All right. Yeah. Eleven is fine. Yeah. Well, you too. Uh, uh, no, no, no, no. Not at all. All right. Well, let's hope so. Good. Well, there you go. Hey, thanks. And Minnie. Minnie. I don't know how to thank you. Both of you just have a fine, healthy baby. That's all. I can't wait to tell Laura Louise. Ah, please don't tell anyone else. Not right away. No, she's right. There's plenty of time now to have a fine, healthy baby.” 
“Hey, he…” </p>
<p>影片的节奏依旧，或者应该说它从来就没改变过。罗斯玛丽醒来发现自己赤身裸体，并且布满了红色的抓痕。盖伊告诉她，他们最终成功地执行了宝宝日的计划。我们能明显地看出，盖伊的扮相充满了憔悴，表达着一种虚情假意，就像他平时会做的事情一样。就像影片开场不久他做的那样，只要哄一哄，罗斯玛丽就什么都不会知道，什么都不会在乎了。在此之后，丈夫盖伊再次对罗斯玛丽冷漠下来。作为太太的罗斯玛丽，不知道是因为丈夫准备新戏，还是发生了什么变故。好在作为观众的我们还是知道的。紧接着月经迟迟不来的罗斯玛丽，就得知了自己怀孕的消息。她非常的开心，但是作为观众的我们则开始惊慌。与我们一同惊慌的，还有着罗斯玛丽的丈夫盖伊。盖伊几乎迫不及待地要去告诉好邻居卡斯维夫妇这一消息。而立刻冲进家门的夫妇俩，第一时间做的事情，居然是换掉罗斯玛丽的医生。这一段落，伴随着罗斯玛丽的甜蜜心情，以及作为拥有上帝视角的观影人，也就是我们的复杂感受，形成了一种很难以诉说的情绪。就像女性在怀孕期间很难诉说清楚自己的脾气一样。</p>
<p>“What's that? I'm happy to be, darling. As soon as I'll tell Minnie you paid for that. Guy, I have a pain where here, just nine since Monday. A sharp pain. What did you see Sapirstein in? I'm seeing him on Wednesday. But this is ridiculous. I mean, why don't you see Sapirstein? I mean, why don't you see an… I see him Wednesday, regular. An entirely natural expansion of the pelvis. You can fight it with ordinary aspirin. I was afraid it might be an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic? I thought you weren't going to read books, Rosemary. It was staring at me in the drugstore. Then all I did was worry. Will you go home and throw it away, please? The pains will be gone in two days. Ectopic pregnancy. I look awful. Are you talking about? You look great.” 
“It's that haircut that looks awful. You want the truth, honey? That's the worst mistake you ever made.” </p>
<p>悲剧开始了。电影最折磨人的段落开始了。如果各位管之前的那些桥段叫惊悚悬疑，那么最好好好想想该如何形容接下来的剧情。我们看到了罗斯玛丽剪了短发，同时告诉自己的丈夫盖伊她似乎有着不正常的疼痛。医生则叫她不要担心，并且还斥责她不遵医嘱，居然自己去翻阅医学书籍。而罗斯玛丽的情况也越来越糟糕。影片用着大篇幅的段落与镜头，描写她心理上的无助与肉体上的痛苦。同时她还发现，自己的口味也发生了奇怪的变化，她开始喜欢吃生肉。故事花了浓重的笔墨，用来描写和表现罗斯玛丽的精神状态以及生理状态，表现一个女人的无助情绪。同时又刻意地强调了另外一个细节，那就是罗斯玛丽做了一个全新的发型，她换的发型我想大家应该都有见过，就是大名鼎鼎的赫本头。联系女性主义运动，再联系赫本，再联系罗斯玛丽，再看看她丈夫盖伊的评价——“啊，别告诉我你为这个付钱了”，我们就会清楚故事想要表达什么了。</p>
<p>“Oh, rubbish. Pregnant women gain weight. They don't lose it. I don't sleep when I have stiff joints or something. So I get a pain. Nothing serious. Um, congratulations. You must be very happy. Oh, I, Anne, we both are. Who's your obstetrician? Abraham Sapirstein. Oh, he delivered two of my daughter's babies. He's one of the best in the city. When did you see him last? Um, yesterday. And, and he says it's fairly common. How much weight have you lost?” 
“Three pounds, or on since you've lost far more than that. It's perfectly normal to lose a little at first. Later on, I'll be gaining. You.” 
“We must assume Dr. Sapirstein knows whereof he speaks. He should, he charges enough. We're getting bargain rates. Our neighbors are close friends of his. I'll go. I know, I'll stay where you are. That's less when I move around. Oh, I was just talking about you favorably, I hope. Do you need anything from outside?” 
“No, thank you for asking.” 
“Is Guy home already?” 
“No, he won't be home till six. Our friend is here. Would you… would you like to meet him? What if I won't be intruding?” 
“No, no, please come in. Hutch, this is Roman Castevet. Edward Hutchins. How do you do? Know. How are you, sir? I was just telling her that it was you and Minnie who sent me to Dr. Sapirstein. Also, Rosemary has told you the good news. Yes, yes. Well, we must see that she gets plenty of rest. I is a bit alarmed by her appearance.” 
“Well, she has lost some weight. But that's quite normal for the early months. Later on, she'll gain probably far too much. It's.” 
“So I gathered, Leah. Mrs. Castevet makes a vitamin drink for me every day from fresh herbs. She grabs, it's all according to Dr. Sapirstein's directions, of course.” 
“Oh, he's inclined to be suspicious of commercially prepared vitamin pills. She indeed was surely that manufactured under every imaginable safeguard.” 
“Oh, that's quite true. But commercial pills can sit for months on a druggist's shelf and lose a great deal of their original potency. And I have thought of that. I like the idea of having everything fresh and natural. I bet expectant mothers took bits of tannis root when nobody even heard of vitamin pills.” 
“Tannis root? It's one of the herbs she puts in the drink. Or is it a herb? Can a root be a herb? Are you sure you don't mean anise or oise root or a tannis?” 
“Hmm.” 
“It's a good luck, too. Uh.” 
“Doesn't look like root, matter. More like mold or fungus of some kind. Is she let me call by any other name? Oh, not to my knowledge. No. Huh? Tannis.” 
“I must look it up in the encyclopedia. But a pretty hole, a charm or whatever it is, the Castevets gave it to me. You and your wife seem to be taking better care of Rosemary than her own parents. Oh, we're very fond of her and of Guy too. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll have to go. My wife is waiting for me. It's a pleasure to meet you. Oh, I don't bother Rosemary. So we'll meet again, I'm sure.” 
“I just noticed he has pierced ears. Pierced ears and piercing eyes.” 
“What's she like?” 
“Nosy. Funny. Guy's gotten very close to them. I suppose they've become sort of parent figures for him. I don't know. Sometimes I think they're too friendly and helpful.” 
“Hey, what a surprise. How are you, Hutch? Good. This is a surprise. What happened? Oh, they stopped for a rewrite, those dumb pasties. Ah, still we are. Nobody move. Would you like some coffee?” 
“Love some.” 
“Seems congratulations are in order. And it's wonderful with it. When's the baby, darling? June twenty-eighth. Did you know that Dr. Sapirstein delivered two of her children's grandchildren? Really?” 
“Huh. I met your neighbor from Roman Castevet. Beautiful. Funny old that isn't me, Guy. Did you ever notice he has pierced ears? You kidding?” 
“No, no, I saw. Uh, it's a shame. We haven't seen more of you lately. Hutch, with me being so busy, and roll… being the way she is, really haven't seen anyone. Perhaps we can have dinner together soon, and not going. I thanks for coffee, my dear. For coming, my dear. This isn't mine. It must be yours. Right? You are. Have you thought about names or is it too soon?” 
“Andrew Douglas. If it's a boy. Melinda, a Sarah. It's a girl. Sarah would happen as Susan. So, is there another of these around? Oh.” 
“I don't see it. Hutch, no, it's not here. I'll probably leave for the city center. I'll stop back there. Let's really have that dinner, shall we? Definitely next week. Bye.” 
“It's a nice surprise. Guess what he said. What? I look terrible. Uh, good old Hutchy spreading cheer wherever he goes.” 
“He's a professional crepe hanger. He's not a professional. And he's one of the top-ranking amateurs.” 
“Hello, hello. No, it's not too big for this. Why? I think she is sleeping.” 
“Oh, I didn't. Well, she could be. Yeah. What are you doing? Like we hold on. It's Hutch.” 
“He wants to speak to you.” 
“Oh, I told him you were resting, but he said he couldn't wait. He… Tell me, dear, do you go out at all?” 
“Well, I… I… I haven't been going out.” 
“Why can't you meet me tomorrow morning at eleven in front of the Time-Life building? If you want me to. What is it?” 
“Can't you tell me now? I'd rather not. We can have an early lunch if you like it. That would be nice. Good, eleven o'clock. Okay.” 
“Oh, did you find your glove?” 
“No, they didn't have it. Good night. Sleep, you too. Good night.” 
“What was that? He wants to talk to me. What about? I don't know, he wouldn't say. I think those boy's adventure stories are going to his head. Where are you meeting? Uh, Time-Life building, tomorrow, eleven o'clock. This is me. Thank you.” 
“This… You're pregnant? I've got the end. I'm gonna get an ice cream cone. You want one? Yeah, I love one. You know what, uh, okay, okay. Hi, hi, Minnie. I'm going up. No. So I won't have my drink at eleven. Well, that's fine, dear. Take it late. Buzz me when you get back. Now, pain be gone. I will have no more of thee.” 
“Yes. This is Edward Hutchins's apartment. Yes. Who is this, please?” 
“Uh, my name is Rosemary Woodhouse. I had an appointment with Mr. Hutchins. Is he there?” 
“Hello. He was taken ill this morning. Taken ill? Yes. He's in a deep coma at St. Vincent's Hospital. That's awful. I… I… I… I… I just spoke to him last night about… about ten, thirty. I spoke to him at eleven. Who is this? You don't know me, Rosemary. I'm Grace Gordon, a friend of Hutch's. And do they… do they know what's causing it? No, they don't know. Yet. At the moment, he's totally unresponsive. Very good. Who… I'm going to the hospital now. Is there anything I can do? Not really. Right. Um, thank you. No. This is what I call a long… I'm a coincidence. Oh, ha ha ha. Hi. I said to myself, 'As long as Rosemary's going out, I might as well go out and do a little bit of Christmas shopping.' And I hear you are a riot, and that's something. Oh, darling, what's the matter?” 
“You feel all right?” 
“哦哦，也不错。” 
“Uh, you know what I think? I think we better be going home. Now, what'd you say? No, no, you have… you have your shopping to do. I should get two more. We got…” </p>
<p>这一幕，一直扮演罗斯玛丽老父亲角色的哈奇先生，在见到她时，最先惊奇的不是她的发型，而是她为何状态会差到像是一个集中营里的犯人。故事的这一幕非常重要。哈奇前来探望罗斯玛丽，此时好邻居卡斯维先生突然出现，就像监视犯人一般地挤进门来，给我们一种他想要隔绝罗斯玛丽的任何社交一般的感受。从镜头、叙事以及故事脉络来看，这种感受无疑是正确的。哈奇先生智慧、富有见识，因此在三人闲聊到罗斯玛丽的产科大夫，再到维生素药丸转进到坦尼斯根时，哈奇表现出了他敏锐的一面。作为一名作家，特别对于一个冒险小说的作家而言，好奇也许是一种无法剔除的特质。因此他在卡斯维先生面前表现出了疑惑，表示自己从来没有听说过这类草药，并大致地判断这种叫做坦尼斯根的植物闻起来更像是一种真菌。这一段耐人寻味的地方在于，我们的卡斯维先生没有久留，换来的却是一早回家的盖伊。就像是有人通知需要他这么做一样。而在这一段落当中，更是大篇幅地描写了另一个细节，那就是哈奇遗失了他的一只手套，以及盖伊对于哈奇到访的厌恶，和对自己太太的满不在乎。很快，哈奇先生就致电罗斯玛丽，约罗斯玛丽见面。这一切的安排，显然都暴露在了监视他的人眼前，也就是她的丈夫。就像我们能看出盖伊寻找出门的借口有多么地蹩脚一样，我们也同样能猜测到他真正要做的不是买冰淇淋，而是通风报信。同时我们也一样能够理解，为何罗斯玛丽会在这些细节上表现得如此迟钝。因为她的疼痛，就像在见哈奇的当天我们所看到的她的精神状态一样，很难不让人觉得这个女人已经陷入到了精神崩溃的边缘。更不用说在得知自己的良师益友突然在约会当天的早上陷入昏迷这件事情了。这无疑对她来说又是一个打击。而突然出现的卡斯维夫人，则又像作为观众的我们，印证了那个猜测：罗斯玛丽已经被监视和控制了。</p>
<p>“Planning the menu. We're having a party a week from Saturday. It's for our old… I mean, our young friends. Minnie and Roman are not invited. Neither is Laura Louise, nor is Dr. Sapirstein. It's gonna be a very special party. You have to be under sixty to get in. For a minute there, I think I was gonna make it. Oh, you'll make it all right. You… you can be bartender. Oh, swell. Do you really think he's such a good idea? I think it's the best idea I've had in months. Don't you think you ought to check with Doctor Sapirstein first? I'm just giving a body. I'm not swimming the English Channel. What about the pain? Oh, haven't you heard? It'll go away in a day or two.” 
“That looks interesting. With… for… We're having some people over on Saturday. Oh, you feel alienated? Yes, I do. These are old friends. I haven't seen in a long time. They don't even know yet that I'm pregnant. Yeah, I'll give you a hand if you like. I'll help you dish things out. Oh, no. Thank you, Minnie, but I can manage. It's going to be a buffet, and we're getting a bartender. So I'll help you take the cold. Oh, no, really. You do too much for me as it is. Well, I mean, if you change your mind, drink, drink him.” 
“I'd rather not. Not right this minute. I'll drink it in a little while. But don't do the letters, then. No, I won't. Wait too long. You go on back. And now I'll bring the glass back to you later. Oh, I'll wait. I'll save you the work. You'll do no such thing. It makes me very nervous when people watch me cook. Now, scoot. Well, I don't. Let us take too long. It's gonna lose its vitamins. You dirty, dirty secret keeps for congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you. See it goes yard.” 
“Uh, Lily. I got stuck in another party. Debut. They'll be over right away. Oh, fine. Look like a piece of chalk.” 
“Do you make and feed you love?” 
“Maybe Marcato lived.” 
“Yeah, the Trench Sisters. French, French, French. They hate little children. Doesn't just mean they ate them. He means they are you. Like the first one. Strong to get them happy. Then I go like that once, sir. Right. Uh, Rosie, you feel okay? You look a little tired. Thanks for the understatement. How do you like C.C. Hill? He's a dream boy. But I… I… I'm not… I'm not going to him. You're not? I've got another doctor named Sacristy. Molderman. Oh, congratulations!” 
“Thanks for nothing to it, Ro. I'm gonna take that Dipens Center. Oh, yeah, please.” 
“Yeah. At least would you give me a hand? Oh, yeah, sure. It… Whenever happened to the other guys? He's still blind.” 
“Donald Bumgard. Will you know who he is? He's the boy that's so popular. Oh, it's the one. Yeah.” 
“He's writing a play, listen. He's still blind.” 
“Excuse. He's going through hell trying to make the adjustment. And he dictates. And so, right? You imagine the… this guy. He's just blind a few months. No. He's quite a… You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just had a cramp for a minute. It's a… It's all right. It's good for. Let her cry it out. Sorry, darling. It's all right. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Eh, what?” 
“Sorry, girl. Can't. She's busy. But I have to use the bathroom. I've heard so much. I'm so afraid. Baby's gonna die. When did the pain start?” 
“Oh, it… November. November. What? You have been in pain since November. And he's not doing anything to help you. He says it's gonna stop. Why don't you go to see another doctor? No, he's very good. He was an open end. It sounds like a sadistic nut. Roseberry, pain like that is a warning that something isn't right. Go see Dr. Hill. Go see anybody besides that… that… that nut. You can't go on suffering like this. I won't have an abortion. Nobody's telling you to have an abortion. Just go to see another doctor. That's all.” 
“Thing to do now is move, Guy. I'm going to Dr. Hill Monday morning. Dr. Sapirstein is either lying or he's… I don't know, out of his mind. Pain like this is a warning. Something's wrong. And I'm not drinking Minnie's drink anymore. I want vitamins in pills like everyone else. I… I haven't drunk it for the last three days. I've thrown it away.” 
“You what? I've made my own drink. Is that what those bitches were giving you in there? Is that their hint for today, my friends? They are a bunch of not very bright bitches who ought to mind their own goddamn bitch. All they said was, 'Get a second opinion, Rosemary.' You got the best doctor in New York. You know who Dr. Hill is. He's a Charlie. Nobody. That's who he is. I'm tired of hearing how great Dr. Sapirstein is. Well, we'll have to pay Sacristy. We'll have to pay Hill. Well, it's out of the question.” 
“Uh, uh-oh. No. I'm not changing. I just want to go to Dr. Hill and get a second opinion. I won't let you do it, Roman. I mean, because it's, uh… it's not fair to Sapirstein. Not fair to… What are you talking about? What about what's fair to me? You want a second opinion? You tell Sapirstein, and, and, and let him decide. No, I… I want Dr. Hill. At least you won't pay. Then I'll… I'll feel…” 
“Roll. Rosemary, what is it? One paint. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I wasn't that drinking, ma'am. Ex-milk. Shock. Shock. What else? What else? Oh, Rosemary, for Christ's sakes. What else was in that drink? It's alive, God! It's moving! It's alive!” 
“It's all right. Fei Ying. Fei Ying. Don't be scared. It won't buy. Oh, it's wonderful. His dreaming. He feels like kicking. It's alive. It's moving.” 
“I, uh, some of the sp…” </p>
<p>罗斯玛丽的状态越来越糟糕，对生肉的欲望也更加强烈。她此刻就像是一个站在悬崖边上的人，命运只要吓唬那么一下，她就会滑落深渊。于是她尝试自救。就像那一时期大多数美国女性都会做的事情一样，生存的本能让她意识到有人在控制与监视她，所以她决定举行一场派对，利用一场派对来摆脱那种感知所带来的警示。并且她明确地提出，这场派对将不会有好邻居卡斯维夫妇的加入。反叛情绪的出现是必然的，就像被呵护的孩子也会想要摆脱好好父母的怀抱一样。罗斯玛丽开始学会拒绝卡斯维夫人，并且偷偷倒掉卡斯维夫人为她准备的营养饮料。怀疑的情绪被无限地扩大着，直到派对开始，罗斯玛丽长久以来的第一次恢复了她的社交。在这一幕当中，我们依旧能观察出盖伊对于罗斯玛丽的监视，他妄图支开罗斯玛丽身边的所有人，并且在罗斯玛丽陷入崩溃，尝试与朋友吐露心声之际，还妄图加入谈话。从这一幕开始，观众的疑惑情绪已经逐渐化解，或者应该说，观众的悬疑情绪已经从“究竟发生了什么”变为了“盖伊和卡斯维夫妇究竟想要做什么呢？”这一幕的后半段，打造了一个令人胆战的情景。满地的狼藉，就像是对一个充满矛盾的家庭生活进行的侧写。而最可怕的就是制造这些狼藉的发起者——罗斯玛丽。在这一幕与她的丈夫盖伊发生了争吵，因为在派对当中与自己朋友的沟通，让她坚信卡斯维夫妇为她找的大夫有着很大的问题，至少在她的孕期是不应该有如此强烈的疼痛的。两人的争吵，从罗斯玛丽的朋友到对错，再到她们的好邻居卡斯维夫妇，到金钱到家庭共济关系。盖伊在这里展现出了一种霸道，几乎以一种审问的方式在向罗斯玛丽问话。从他接近罗斯玛丽的肢体动作上，我们就能看出来，同样的肢体动作经常被用作于动作谍战类的电影的审讯情景里，就比如电影《边境杀手2》里就出现了与盖伊一个一模一样的审问犯人的动作。戏剧的地方就在于，也就是在这一幕，折磨罗斯玛丽已久的疼痛突然消失了，争吵也戛然而止。</p>
<p>“Thanks, boys. Have one on the baby. Thanks very much.” 
“What's that for? It's my… my hospital suitcase.” 
“Honey, you got three weeks.” 
“Yes. Hello, Mrs. Gardy.” 
“No.” 
“Oh my God. Oh my God. Yes, of course I will. Pop is dead. I feel awful. All this time, I didn't even think of him. Yours will see you later. Thank you.” 
“Pardon?” 
“I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.” 
“I knew your father, so you're Rosemary. I'm terribly sorry.” 
“Thank you. This is my sister, Edna.” 
“How do you do? How do you do? And my husband. How do you?” 
“How do you do?” 
“I'm sorry to be late.” 
“Excuse me. Yes.” 
“I'm Grace Gordon.” 
“Oh, I was helping to meet you. Thank you for calling me. I was going to mail this. But then I thought you would be here. What is it? A book?” 
“Hutch regained consciousness at the end. And he thought it was the next morning. You know, when you had the appointment. Oh, yes. I wasn't there. But he told the doctor to make sure that you got the book that was on his desk. Thank you. Oh, and I'm to tell you the name is an anagram. The name of the book.” 
“Apparently he was delirious, so it's hard to be sure. I heard you command standing went very long. I was later couldn't get a taxi.” 
“Oh, what a shame. You got mail already?” 
“Somebody gave it to me. Yeah, I'll hold it, boss. I know that house. That Gilmore. You still live there? Oh, yeah. Oh, I've been there lots of time.” 
“Grace, that's one of my favorite names. Yes. Yeah. You need anything? Nothing. Thank you. You took that point, don't you? I'm going to say goodbye. Been Glasgow in eighteen forty-six.” 
“He will soon after brought to New York. He was edited for several years in the night. So attacked by a mob outside the brand. Outside, not in the lobby. There are no witches. Not really. Name is an anagram. And that really makes sense.” </p>
<p>之后的一切都很正常，甚至可以用幸福来形容。罗斯玛丽和盖伊准备婴儿房，她的气色逐渐恢复正常。唯一的变故就发生在哈奇的死上。罗斯玛丽去参加哈奇的葬礼，并且收到了哈奇的遗物——一本书。还刻意地提到了名字以及变位字等内容。作为观众的我们自然明白，哈奇的遗物是在提醒罗斯玛丽。我们也更加清楚，为何卡斯维夫人再一次地出现在罗斯玛丽的家门口。故事节奏在这里被加快，罗斯玛丽很快就了解到了哈奇留给她的遗产究竟为何。那是一本关于巫术的书籍，书籍里描写了黑魔法仪式，以及一种叫做恶魔胡椒的真菌。这种真菌经常被用来举行幻灵等恶魔仪式。同时她也通过填字游戏，找出了哈奇所说的变位字的意义为何，正是好邻居卡斯维一家的姓氏。更准确来说应该是卡斯维先生。他的本性应该是马卡托，而他的父亲，就是曾经在这栋大厦里举行幻灵仪式，妄图召唤撒旦，而差点被活活烧死的黑巫师。</p>
<p>“And I don't think you ought to read any more of that. This last chat. Not today, honey. Your hands are shaking. Uh, come on, give it to me. You read it, Guy. I mean it. Now, give it to me. Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. What do you say? The name was Marcato. Marcato. Fantastic. I think he told me once his father was a coffee importer. He told Guy he was a producer. Understand how disturbed you must be at to having it for a close neighbor. I don't want anything more to do with him or Minnie. I can't take even the slightest chance with the baby's safety. Is there any more than feel the same way? Is there any chance at all that may be Minnie put something harmful in those drinks or in those little cakes? Oh, Rosemary, I'd have seen evidence of it long ago.” 
“I won't take anything else from that. Well, I have to.” 
“I can give you some pills. It'll be adequate these last few weeks. In a way, this may be the answer to Minnie and Roman's problem too. What do you mean? Roman's very ill, in fact. Confidentially, has no more than a month or two left to him. I have no idea. He wanted to pay a last visit to a few of his favorite cities. They didn't want to offend you by leaving before the baby's birth. I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well. He'd be extremely embarrassed if I told him what you found out. Suppose we do this, I'll tell them to leave on Sunday. I'll see I spoke to you and you understand. Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday? I'll see to it. No matter where we are, thought are gonna be with you every minute. Dollar to New Orleans, happy and thin again. Your sweet boy girls laying safe in your arms. Yes, thank you, thank you for everything. Yeah, you make Guy send us lots of pictures. Yes, I will.” 
“Now, I'm not going to wish you good luck because you won't need it. You're going to have a happy, happy life. Have a good trip and come back. Fighting perhaps, but I may stay on you. Robnic, CBS, or maybe New York. We shall see. We shall see. Come back. Bye, Minnie.” 
“Goodbye, goodbye, Roman. Bye, bye. Take care. No. Kennedy Airport. Can I? Under the trees. Bye, bye, bye. Oh, boy. Guy, um, where's my book?” 
“Oh, I… Yeah, put it in the garbage. What? I didn't want you upsetting yourself anymore.” 
“Guy, Hutch gave me that book. He left it to me. I wasn't thinking about that. It's a terrible thing to do. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking about Hutch.” 
“Hey, watch out, lady. Some… It was believed that a personal possession of the victim was necessary. And spells cannot be cast without one of the victim's belongings. Yeah.” 
“Is… is this done? And by Guy? This is Rosemary Woodhouse. Guy Woodhouse's wife. Oh, yes. I want my God. You must be a happy little lady just living in the Branford. I want to know how you are. If there's been an improvement.” 
“Well, bless your heart. I got Woodhouse as well. Well, I'm splendid. I only broke six glasses today. Guy and I are both very unhappy that he got his break because of your misfortune. What the hell? That's the way it goes, right?” 
“I'm sorry I didn't come along that day he came to visit you.” 
“No. Oh, oh, you mean… you mean the day we met for… for drinks? Yes, that's what I mean.” 
“Right. By the way, he has something of yours. You know what? Do you mean? He… Don't you… don't you know? Didn't you miss anything that day? You… you know me. My time. Do you?” 
“Yes.” 
“Oh, well, well, he's got mine. And I've got his. He can have it back. I'm… It doesn't matter to me now. What color? Did we… didn't understand. I thought he'd only brought it. No, no, no, no, no. I did.” 
“It was a… it was a trade. Or do you think he's stolen? I have to hang up now. I just wanted to know if they've been in any improvement. No, no. There is. Nice to call by.” </p>
<p>可惜罗斯玛丽的斗争是他个人的，而她面临的敌人却是一个组织。她本应该能够最依靠的人，不信任她从哈奇那得到的信息，即使那是一位已故老人的遗物。因为这个人，她的丈夫已经成为了她的敌人。更不用说她的医生，以及似乎察觉到罗斯玛丽开始怀疑而扬言要离开纽约的卡斯维夫妇了。卡斯维夫妇的离去，似乎足以成为一个让罗斯玛丽感到安心的理由。只是丈夫盖伊欲盖弥彰地丢掉哈奇的遗物，也就是那本充满了线索与提示的巫师书籍，再一次地勾起了她的担心。心理的挣扎与疑惑，促使罗斯玛丽探明究竟，也让她知道了黑巫师们法术的能力，以及施法的必要步骤。他们能让受害者麻痹失明，但是必须要有一件受害者使用的物品，才能进行施法仪式。在踌躇之中，她确认了另外一件事情，那就是作为她丈夫竞争对手的演员，那位先生的失明与自己的丈夫有无关系。这件事情换句话来说就是，她想要知道丈夫是不是已经成为了那些巫师们的一员，他是否还能够信任她。显然，答案令她不能接受，但她也不得不接受，那就是她的丈夫已经深陷其中了。</p>
<p>“Doctor Hill's office.” 
“Uh, Doctor Hill, please.” 
“This is his answering service. Would you like to leave a message?” 
“Eum. Yes, my name is Rosemary Woodhouse. Woodhouse. And, um, would you ask him to call me back right away, please? Uh, uh, my number is 4752598. It's an emergency. I'm in a phone booth.” 
“All right. Please talk to you. Call me.” 
“Oh, oh, really? Did… did he really say that? Oh, he didn't… didn't say that. What? What else was it that… that he said? Oh, that's… that's wonderful. That's one, that's marvelous. Yes. Doctor Hill. Did I get the name right? Is it Rosemary Woodhouse? Yes. Are you Dr. Hill's patient?” 
“No. Uh, yes. I mean, well, I've… I've seen him once. Um, please, please tell him he has to speak to me. It's important. Tell him to call me, honey. Right. Thank you.” 
“我饿死。 Than older than in witches. Don't you worry. Little Andy or Jenny, I'll kill the… before I live and touch you. Yes, doctor, this is what else. Yes. Oh, thank you. Thank you for calling me. That you're in California? No. No. I've… I've been to another doctor and he… he isn't good, Dr. Hill. He's been lying to me.” 
“And giving me unusual kinds of drinks and capsules. The baby's due on Tuesday. Remember, you told me June twenty-eighth. Well, I want you to deliver it. Mrs. Woodhouse, no. Please, please, let me… let me talk to you. Let me come and explain what's been going on. I can't stay too long here. They'll… they'll be coming looking for me. Dr. Hill, Dr. Hill, there's a plot. I know that sounds crazy. You're probably thinking, 'My God, this poor girl is really flipped.' But I… I haven't flipped about Dr. Hill. I swear by all the saints. I haven't. There are plots against people. Aren't there? Yes, I suppose there are. Well, there's one against me and my baby. Come to my office tomorrow after five. No, right now. This is what else. I'm not at my office now.” 
“I'm home. I've been up since yesterday morning. I beg you. I beg you. I can't stay here. My office at eight o'clock. Yes, thank you. Oh, wait up. Wait. Doctor Hill. Um, my husband may call you and ask if you… I'm not gonna speak to anyone. I'm gonna take a nap. Hey, he lied to you. He said we were going to Hollywood. The worst thing of all. He's involved with them as well. He sleeps in pajamas now. He never used to before. He's probably hiding a mark. You know, they give you marks when you join all sorts of rituals. They hold Sabbaths there. You could hear them singing through the wall. Guy, my… my husband, Guy, said it was Dr. Shaw, one of these people playing a recorder. Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shaw, unless he was there with them? Um, they're very clever people. They planned everything right from the beginning. They probably made some sort of deal with Guy. They gave him success, and he promised them our baby to use in their rituals. I know this sounds crazy. But I've… I've got books here. Look. There was another actor like him, Donald Baumgart. And they put a spell on him. They cast a spell on him and made him blind. So that Guy could get his part. Look here. I had this friend, Edward Hutchins. Maybe you heard of him, a writer. He wrote stories for boys. Anyway, he was my good friend since I first came to New York. May I keep this? Yes, please. Endo. Anyway, once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me. Came to visit me. It was the time I was having this pain. Doctor, I was suffering. So you can't imagine how much I was suffering. And they wouldn't help me. Nobody would. They were giving me a drink with tannis root in it. Also, witches' stuff. Tannis root. Arch came and immediately saw something was wrong. He… he knew about witches, you see. Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup still on, which he never did. They probably called him to come home and steal one of Hutch's belongings, which he did, took his glove. And they put a spell on him too. Put him in a coma. Three months later, he died. Now, maybe all this is coincidence. But one thing is for sure. They have a coven, and they want my baby.” 
“I was sleeping. Come with this quietly. Rose. Mary, don't argue and make a scene. Because if you say anything more about witches or witchcraft, you'll be forced to go to a mental hospital. You don't want that, do you? So put your shoes on. We just want to take you home. No one's gonna hurt you or the baby. Put your shoes on. She's fine. Now we've got to go home and rest. That's all it takes. Thank you for your trouble. Lock her. Relicity. It helps. So shame you. How to come in here.” 
“Good evening, Mrs. Woodhouse.” 
“This is Woodhouse. This is Woodhouse.” 
“Oh, wrong. Hey, roll, roll. Come on, open up, Brian. Got a hell. Come on, honey. No one's gonna hurt you. You promise? Then the baby? No, get out. Promising anything. What are you talking about? Promise. Rosemary, you two get away.” 
“Hello, Elise. Mrs. Dunston is out. Who is this? The babysitter. Do you know where she went? They went to the movies. This is Rosemary. Please ask her to call Rosemary the second she gets out. It's terribly urgent. Don't, don't forget. Don't worry. I'll tell her. Thank you.” 
“We don't want to hurt you, Rose. Are your friends, Rosemary? There's nothing to be afraid of, Rose. Marry. Honest and truly, there isn't. There is nothing but a mild sedative to calm you down. You know, I wouldn't let anyone. Rose. Help me. Somebody help me. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We have to be in labor here. Here, here. You're right. Baby, you're gonna be perfectly all right. I swear it, Guy.” 
“Don't call me, please. Don't. Be perfectly all right. I'll give you my absolute. Sarah. Oh, oh, she is in heroes. I'll have a pill. You back.” 
“Oh, Andy, and you, Jenny. Oh, I'm sorry. My little darling. Forgive me.” </p>
<p>电影此时迎来了第二次高潮，也就是罗斯玛丽的反抗。她选择出走。作为一名母亲，她此时的判断，邪教徒、黑巫师们想要伤害她腹中的孩子。于是合情合理的，她第一时间想到了她的一生。这是故事在这一段落中营造的第一个紧张点，因为作为观众的我，自然是能猜测出那位医生也是有着很大问题的。幸好，不再被疼痛折磨的罗斯玛丽已经不再迟钝。她很快从护士的只言片语中察觉到了危险，认识到了我们早已猜到的那个结果。走投无路的她，只得转头寻找她的前产科大夫。可惜她最终还是被带回了布拉德福德公寓。只是罗斯玛丽的反抗并没有就此结束。也就是在她的这第二次反抗中，我们见证到了整部影片最为戏剧化，也是最为诡异的一个镜头。罗斯玛丽故意地散落了自己随身携带的物品，随着物品散落的，还有一张又一张的百元大钞。而她的丈夫盖伊，以及那位外表睿智的产科大夫，则像是着了魔似的，立刻弯身去摸索捡拾那些钞票。影片的配乐以及镜头结构，就像是在拍摄野兽分食刚刚捕捉到的猎物一般。我们都清楚地知道导演的用意为何，我们也能清楚地感受到那种颤栗而又诡异的气氛。至少我们切实体会到了罗斯玛丽的心情了，那就是她感觉自己根本就不是在与人打交道。罗斯玛丽一路狂奔，将自己反锁在家中，妄图通过电话联系自己的朋友以寻求帮助。这里又出现了另一个有趣的镜头：两个蹑手蹑脚的人，以一种卡通片似的怪异姿势，从罗斯玛丽身后的门廊走过。如果真的是在看卡通片，我们不会有任何独特的感受。但是在目前这个犹如密室一般的场景之下，特别是在危险就在门外的情形之下，这种突如其来的犹如玩笑般的情节，足以让人汗毛倒立。更戏剧的是，当一堆人就像庆生一般地走进卧室时，甚至所谓观众的我们，都来不及做出任何的思考和反应，就随着一针镇静剂，与罗斯玛丽一同面对接下去的命运了。很快的，我们知道了罗斯玛丽即将临盆，更快的我们知道孩子出生了。罗斯玛丽醒来，开始她的第三次反抗。这也是影片的结局。她下床穿过门廊，拿起了厨房里最长的切肉刀。她隐藏自己，目的非常简单，就是为了抢回自己的孩子。她猜测自己的孩子就在卡斯维夫妇家，她记得他们的公寓之间原本就是相通的。一连串的镜头特写，描写了罗斯玛丽的决心。她的手拿切肉刀，大步流星地向她的目标前进。罗斯玛丽就这样拿着刀走进她自知可能充满危险的、坐满了邪教徒的客厅之中。而在场众人的反应，无论是注意到她的，或是没注意到她的，都足够地戏剧化。那就是所有人都很镇定，包括了罗斯玛丽自己。所有的情感都不偏不倚地留在了她看到了自己的孩子以后。直至此刻，罗斯玛丽的情绪从凶狠转变为疯狂，与在其对面的卡斯维夫妇的镇定与诡异，形成了强烈的反差和对比。影片也至此，借由这段掺杂着理智与疯狂的一幕，揭露了所有的疑惑。然而最令人吃惊的便是，故事的结局并不是谜底，一切的悬念都留给了罗斯玛丽即将要做下的决定之上。</p>
<p>《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》这部影片很独特。听到这里或者看到这里的各位，也应该能够体会到我所说的独特究竟为何了。从表象上来看，这部影片十分符合一部恐怖类惊悚片的结构，但是其主旨和内在却并不是在诉说一个恐怖故事。从表象上来看，这部影片也十分符合宗教与政治隐喻类的剧情片，但是其主旨却更多地在讨论个人与家庭。从表象上来看，这部影片的故事内容具有邪典的气质，但是仔细地翻阅全片，我们却无法找到任何血腥的镜头，或是恶魔式的说教。《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》这部影片的特质复杂，它将众多元素和矛盾，集中在了一个简短的故事里，但是又以一种漫长的方式展现给我们，就像是怀胎10个月的目的，只是简单的孕育下一代的结果一样。它其实是一个关于女性的故事，一个关于女性被夹杂在诸多社会矛盾之中，夹杂在家庭、宗教、权力与自由之下的集合体。而纵使线索错综复杂，纵使过程曲折离奇，也无法改变一个令人无比幸福的结局，那就是你无法真正意义上地剥夺一个人的自由，一个女性的自由。或者应该说，没有人能够剥夺一个人精神上的自由。</p>
<p>许多评论人都将这部影片描绘成“撒旦版的圣母故事”。而在我看来，无论是上帝版的还是撒旦版的，它们都无法逃脱一个主旨，那就是女性。所以，与其说这是一个撒旦版的圣母故事，不如说它是在一个特定时代，一个处于宗教矛盾、自由矛盾、人权矛盾、家庭矛盾的反叛女性如何面对成为一位母亲这么一件事情的故事。故事的结局并不重要，重要的是其过程。罗斯玛丽以一名女性望向生命之光的历险，她所经历的磨难，又为何遭受这些磨难，这才是最重要的。如果硬是要说这是一个撒旦故事，那么这个故事中，最有可能成为撒旦的便是她的丈夫盖伊。他用卑鄙的方式使罗斯玛丽怀孕，用过分的态度与其生活，用落后的思想限制其自由。他堕落而又争名逐利，他并不善解人意，却又拥有着谎话连篇的品质。这一切都印证了盖伊的邪恶。就像我们在之前说到的那句话一样：“有什么比见到一位不认识的魔鬼更好的事情？那就是见到一位已经认识的魔鬼。”影片也同样充斥着导演对于宗教的不屑，以及对于魔鬼崇拜的讽刺。导演罗曼·波兰斯基，想必大家都认识更是了解。在影片的最后，他也借助恶魔这一话题，暗讽了他所憎恶的纳粹分子。OK，我们这期节目就差不多了。那其实还有很多话想说，我们也只是从一个方面聊了《罗斯玛丽的婴儿》这部影片。其实这部影片很复杂啊，如果从人文的角度来看的话，它可以有很多不同版本的解读啊。至少我自己就有很多不同版本的解读，都是从不同的方面出发的。以后有机会的话，我们可以再来聊啊。主要是时长的关系，估计实在是太长了，两个多小时了吧？要有。OK，那我们就先到这。感谢各位的收听与收看，呃，我们之后再见，拜拜。</p>
